<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Fullstack developer student</h3>

<p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering from Azrieli College of Engineering</p>
<p>I am an enthusiastic and dedicated full-stack web developer student with a passion for creating user-friendly and engaging web experiences. I am currently pursuing a full-stack web development program at Appleseed, where I am gaining hands-on experience with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, and React.js.

  I am particularly interested in the front-end aspect of web development, as I enjoy the challenge of creating visually appealing and intuitive interfaces. I am also fascinated by the back-end of web development, and I am eager to learn more about how to build and maintain secure and scalable web applications.
  
  Outside of the classroom, I am actively involved in the web development community. I participate in online forums and attend meetups to connect with other developers and learn about new technologies. I am also a member of my school's web development club, where I collaborate with my peers on projects and participate in hackathons.
  
  I am a quick learner and a problem solver. I am also a team player and I am always willing to help others. I am confident that I have the skills and dedication to be a successful full-stack web developer.</p>
